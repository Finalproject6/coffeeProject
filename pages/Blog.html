            According to a coffee history legend, an Arabian shepherd named Kaldi found his goats dancing joyously around a dark green leafed shrub with bright red cherries in the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula.  Kaldi soon determined that it was the bright red cherries on the shrub that were causing the peculiar euphoria and after trying the cherries himself, he learned of their powerful effect.  The stimulating effect was then exploited by monks at a local monastery to stay awake during extended hours of prayer and distributed to other monasteries around the world.  Coffee was born.
               
           Despite the appeal of such a legend, recent botanical evidence suggests a different coffee bean origin.</p>
           <p> This evidence indicates that the history of the coffee bean beagan on the plateaus of central Ethiopia and somehow must have been brought to Yemen where it was cultivated since the 6th century.  Upon introduction of the first coffee houses in Cairo and Mecca coffee became a passion rather than just a stimulant.

      <p>The coffee plant is a woody perennial evergreen dicotyledon that belongs to the Rubiaceae family.  Because it grows to a relatively large height, it is more accurately described as a coffee tree. It has a main vertical trunk (orthotropic) and primary, secondary, and tertiary horizontal branches (plagiotropic).
    </p>   <p>
      Three to four years after the coffee is planted, sweetly smelling flowers grow in clusters in the axils of the coffee leaves. 
       Fruit is produced only in the new tissue.  The Coffea Arabica coffee plant is self-pollinating,
        whereas the Robusta coffee plant depends on cross pollination.  About 6-8 weeks after each coffee flower is 
        fertilized, cell division occurs and the coffee fruit remains as a pin head for a period that is dependent upon the climate.  
        The ovaries will then develop into drupes in a rapid growth period that takes about 15 weeks after flowering. 
         During this time the integument takes on the shape of the final coffee bean.  After the rapid growth period the
          integument and parchment are fully grown and will not increase in size.

   <p> The endosperm remains small until about 12 weeks after flowering.  At this time it will suppress, consume, and replace the integument.  The remnants of the integument are what make up the silverskin.  The endosperm will have completely filled the cavity made by the integument nineteen weeks after flowing.  The endosperm is now white and moist, but will gain dry matter during the next several months.  During this time the endosperm attracts more than seventy percent of the total photsynthesates produced by the tree.  The mesocarps will expand to form the sweet pulp that surrounds the coffee bean.  The coffee cherry will change color from green to red about thirty to thirty-five weeks after flowing.  See Flash movie on Coffee Bean Development.

       After the buyer has received the green coffee, there are three major steps needed to prepare the green beans for consumption. First the beans must be roasted to just the right level to highlight any outstanding characteristics of the coffee, then the coffee must be ground relative to how it will be brewed. Lastly the freshly roasted and freshly ground coffee must be brewed at the right temperature for the correct amount of time.
    </p>
  
  <p>
    Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps: raw coffee beans must be roasted, the roasted coffee beans must then be ground, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.

    Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.

        <p> Coffee in Jordan – Art and Culture A traditional Bedouin coffee ceremony involves three cups of coffee. Although it is polite to drink the first, it is acceptable to refuse the others. If you don’t want a refill, simply tilt your cup from side to side two or three times as you hand it back. If you do want a top-up, just hold your cup out for more.

          A guest could, if they wish, spark a feud by commenting gahwahtak saydeh (“your coffee is hunted” – that is, tainted or bad). If, in the opinion of those present, the beans are indeed off, there is no problem. If, however, the coffee is good, the guest is then deemed to be deliberately insulting the host. The consequences could be serious.Coffee in Jordan – Art and Culture
      </p>
        <p> In tribal bedouin culture, where the mark of a man is how he treats his guests, and where what is unsaid has as much (or more) resonance than what is said, coffee plays a hugely significant symbolic role.
            Tea-PartyIn some areas, merely starting to make coffee is a signal to
             families in neighbouring tents that something is afoot: by pounding freshly roasted beans in a “mihbash”.</p>
